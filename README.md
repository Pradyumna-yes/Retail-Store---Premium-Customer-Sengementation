# Retail-Store---Premium-Customer-Sengementation
The project aims to implement a decision tree classifier for customer segmentation in a retail store. The decision tree algorithm is used to predict whether a customer is a premium customer based on various input features.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is stored in the file Sangeetha.csv. It contains the following columns:

Customer: Customer information
Store: Store information
Brand: Brand information
Model: Model information
Price: Price information
Premium_Customer: Target variable indicating whether a customer is a premium customer (0 - Not a premium customer, 1 - Premium customer)
Getting Started

# To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

**Clone the repository to your local machine.**

Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script where the code is implemented.
Modify the file path in the code to point to the location of the Sangeetha.csv dataset file.
Run the code to train the decision tree classifier and make predictions.
Usage
The main.ipynb Jupyter Notebook or main.py Python script contains the code for this project. It demonstrates the following steps:

#  **Reading and preprocessing the dataset.**
Performing label encoding for categorical variables.
Creating a decision tree classifier model.
Training the model using the modified inputs and target.
Evaluating the model's accuracy.
Making predictions using the trained model.
You can run the code cell by cell in the Jupyter Notebook or execute the Python script to reproduce the results.

# Results
The decision tree classifier achieved an accuracy score of 100% on the training data. By using the trained model, predictions can be made on new input data to determine whether a customer is a premium customer or not.
